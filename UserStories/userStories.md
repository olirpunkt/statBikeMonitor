# Story 1 - Display RPM
As a rider of a stationary bike I want to see my current rpm so that I can train according to plan (e.g. if the plan says "ride for x minutes with y rpm").

AC:
1. RPM is displayed in a web-application as a gauge
2. RPM gauge shows the difference in RPM to the previous value via "up/down" symbols an the difference value

To be used:
Nodemcu v3 as metering device



# Story 2 - Display Speed
As a rider of a stationary bike (roasb) I want to see my current speed so that I can see how fast I would be on a flat surface "in reality".
